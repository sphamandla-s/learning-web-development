        <sup><a href="">[4]</a></sup> <a href="">Jim Messina</a>, the former

        <sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup>  and <a href="">Jeremy Liew</a>, a partner at 
        <a href="">Lightspeed Venture Partners</a>.<sup><a href="">[5]</a></sup>

        and Rovida Advisors.<sup><a href="">[6]</a></sup>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Blockchain.info was established by Ben Reeves in 2011. He launched a website which could 
        be used to track bitcoin transactions.<a href="">[8]</a></sup> The website was a block explorer,
        a website that allowed bitcoin users to see the details of public cryptocurrency transactions if
        they have the identifying hash code for the transaction.<a href="">[9]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        In early 2012, Reeves and <a href="">Brian Armstrong</a>, the co-founder of crypto-currency exchange 
        <a href=""> Coinbase</a>, applied to <a href="">Y Combinator</a>'s summer class.
        <sup><a href="">[6][8]</a></sup> They proposed a payment platform for bitcoin where 
        users could keep a digital wallet, exchange other currency for bitcoins for a percentage fee, and 
        make payments in bitcoin.<sup><a href="">[8]</a></sup> Due to different opinions they parted ways 
        prior to attending Y Combinator.<sup><a href="">[6][8]</a></sup> Reeves wanted to create a 
        platform where users controlled access to their bitcoin information, while Armstrong felt that 
        the platform should retain custody of the users wallets.<sup><a href="">[8][1]</a></sup> After 
        parting ways with Armstrong, Reeves continued to work on Blockchain.info.
        <sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        From 2013 to 2014, Blockchain's user base grew from 100,000 wallet users in early 2013 to 
        1.5 million in April 2014.<sup><a href="">[10]</a></sup> By 2014, Blockchain.com was the 
        most popular bitcoin wallet and was led by Nicolas Cary as CEO.<sup><a href="">[11]</a></sup> 
        It had acquired two companies, ZeroBlock in 2013, and RTBTC in early 2014, through which it 
        added data analytics services, and brought these services together under one umbrella.
        <sup><a href="">[10]</a></sup> In December 2013, Blockchain.com acquired ZeroBlock, 
        an app for bitcoin pricing.<sup><a href="">[10]</a></sup> The following year, it acquired 
        the data analytics platform RTBTC. It integrated RTBTC's technology with its existing services, 
        establishing one platform offering cryptocurrency wallet, pricing and 
        analytics, and the cryptocurrency explorer.<sup><a href="">[10]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        In February 2014, <a href=""> Apple Inc</a>. removed the Blockchain.com app from the iOS<a href=""> App Store</a>,
        prompting a public outcry in the bitcoin community, most notably within the<a href=""> Reddit</a> community. 
        At the time, it was the only bitcoin wallet app available for Apple users, as Apple had removed 
        or denied other apps.<sup><a href="">[11]</a></sup> In July 2014, Apple reinstated the Blockchain.com app.
        <sup><a href="">[12]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        During 2014, Peter Smith joined the founding team as its CEO.<sup><a href="">[6][5]</a></sup> The three founders, 
        Reeves, Cary and Smith worked from Reeves' flat in York and formally established the 
        company when bitcoin investor <a href=""> Roger Ver</a> provided initial funding.<sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup> By October 2014, 
        it had 2.3 million consumer wallets and raised $30.5 million in its first external 
        fundraising round, with investors including <a href=""> Lightspeed Venture Partners</a> and Mosaic Ventures.
        <sup><a href="">[5]</a></sup> This was the biggest round of financing in the <a href=""> digital currency</a> 
        sector at that time.<sup><a href="">[5]</a></sup> The World Economic Forum named the company as one of 2016's 
        "Technology Pioneers".<sup><a href="">[5]</a></sup> In 2017, the company carried out a second round of fundraising. 
        It closed $40 million in funding that June and the company was valued at $280 million.
        <sup><a href="">[6]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2018, Blockchain started selling services for institutional cryptocurrency.<sup><a href="">[14]</a></sup> 
        In July 2019, Blockchain.com launched its cryptocurrency exchange, and promoted it as faster than others.
        <sup><a href="">[15][16]</a></sup> In September 2020, the company joined the Coalition for App Fairness 
        which aims to negotiate for better conditions for the <a href="">inclusion of apps </a> in app stores.
        <sup><a href="">[17]</a></sup> In mid-2018, the company acquired Tsukemen, an app-development 
        startup company based in San Francisco.<sup><a href="">[18]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2020 the company had 31 million users and as of 2021, there were 65 million Blockchain.com 
        wallets and 28% of bitcoin transactions since 2012 were initiated or received by a Blockchain.com 
        wallet.<sup><a href="">[19] [2]</a></sup>  In February 2021, Blockchain.com raised a 
        $120 million funding round from investors including Moore Strategic Ventures, <a href=""> Kyle Bass</a>, 
        <a href="">Access Industries</a>, Rovida Advisors, <a href=""> Lightspeed Venture Partners</a>, 
        <a href=""> GV</a>,  <a href=""> Lakestar</a>, and <a href=""> Eldridge</a>.<sup><a href="">[20] </a></sup>  
        Including previous venture capital funding rounds, the company had raised $190 million altogether.
        <sup><a href="">[6] </a></sup>  One month later, the company announced a further $300 million 
        fundraising round.<sup><a href="">[21] </a></sup> One third of the amount raised was funded 
        by investment firm <a href="">Baillie Gifford</a>  which invested $100 million.
        <sup><a href="">[7] </a></sup> Based on the fundraising round, the company was 
        valued at $5.2 billion.
