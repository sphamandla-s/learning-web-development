            <h2>STATIC</h2>

            <p>
                The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. 
                The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. 
                This is the default value
            </p>
            
            <div style="background-color: green"></div>

        <section id="relative">

            <h2>RELATIVE</h2>

            <p>
                The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, 
                and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, 
                bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other 
                elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is 
                the same as if position were static. This value creates a new stacking 
                context when the value of z-index is not auto. Its effect on table-*-group, 
                table-row, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined.
            </p>

        <section id="absolute">

            <h2>ABSOLUTE</h2>

            <p>
                The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created 
                for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest 
                positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial 
                containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, 
                bottom, and left. This value creates a new stacking context when the value of 
                z-index is not auto. The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse 
                with other margins.
            </p>

        <section id="fixed">

            <h2>FIXED</h2>

            <p>
                The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for 
                the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing 
                block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, 
                perspective, or filter property set to something other than none 
                (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing 
                block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and filter 
                contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is determined by 
                the values of top, right, bottom, and left. This value always creates a new stacking 
                context. In printed documents, the element is placed in the same position on every page.
