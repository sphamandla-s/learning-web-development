# learning-web-development
I've decided to learn web development and have committed toÂ #100daysofcode. This is my public repository where I will keep track of my progress. I made the decision to make it public so that I do not back down. I will be a full stack web developer after 100 days.

Day 1 - I will be learning HTML tags:

comments
paragraphs

After Today's lesson, i will do a project:
